Title of the Project:Student Enrollment Form

Description:The form is designed to enforce data validation by requiring non-empty fields for roll number, full name, class, birth date, address, and enrollment date.
It includes a JavaScript function (checkPrimaryKey) that verifies the existence of the roll number in the database and enables the appropriate buttons based on the outcome.
When a new roll number is entered, the form allows for data entry and saving.
When an existing roll number is confirmed, the form loads the corresponding student data, enabling data updates and saving.
The primary key (Roll No) remains disabled for editing to ensure data integrity.
The form facilitates data entry, modification, and reset actions for managing student records efficiently.
